SOLID Principles
----------------


Single Responsibility Principle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    #. The idea behind the SRP is that every class, module, or function in a program should have one responsibility/purpose in a program.
    #. As a commonly used definition, "every class should have only one reason to change".
        #. Separation of concerns
    #. **Advantages:**
        #. **Improved code readability:** Reading code that abides by the SRP is easier to follow because it is focused and concise.
            #. A function that is doing too many things outside the realm of its responsibilities creates unnecessary entanglements that makes it harder to read and debug.
